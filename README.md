Explanation:

data/: This directory contains data-related files. The SQL script for data extraction (get_regression.sql) and the initial dataset (Regressiondata.csv) are stored here.
scripts/: The core R script (automated_regression_analysis.R) resides in this directory. This is where your main analysis and automation logic are placed.
output/: This directory is for storing output files generated by your R script. The results of your analysis, such as coef.csv, fittest.csv, coefwithkeys.csv, and insertcoefwithkeys.sql, will be saved here.

# My Regression Project

This repository contains an R project for automated regression analysis using data from Snowflake.

## Directory Structure

- **data/**: Contains SQL script for data extraction and initial dataset.
- **scripts/**: Contains the main R script for automated regression analysis.
- **output/**: Contains output files generated by the analysis.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Install required R packages by running `install.packages(c("DBI", "odbc", "dplyr"))`.

2. **Data Extraction**: Edit `data/get_regression.sql` with your Snowflake connection details. Run `scripts/automated_regression_analysis.R` to extract data and save it to `data/Regressiondata.csv`.

3. **Regression Analysis**: Review and edit `scripts/automated_regression_analysis.R` to set column parameters. Run the script to perform regression and save results to `output/coef.csv` and `output/fittest.csv`.

4. **Update CredReadiness_Factors**: Review and edit `scripts/automated_regression_analysis.R` to set keys. Run the script to create `output/coefwithkeys.csv` and `output/insertcoefwithkeys.sql`.

## Notes

- Make sure to handle credentials securely.
- Review and test the script in your environment before deploying in a production setting.
  NOTE:
  
Please note that you need to replace placeholders like "YourSnowflakeDSN", "ResponseVariable", "PredictorVariable1", "PredictorVariable2", and the keys with your actual values.

This script assumes that you have the necessary R libraries (DBI, odbc, dplyr) installed. You can install them using the following:
install.packages(c("DBI", "odbc", "dplyr"))
